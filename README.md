First pass at collecting all the Tontec 2.8" drivers that I'm using.  This 
is still a work in progress.

Moved to a different LCD driver set, and re-enabled TA=0 which results in
things working, better.  However ts_calibrate hangs the display and the
touch screen drivers still.

But evtest doesn't seem to.  Which is progress
