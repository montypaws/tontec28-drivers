First pass at collecting all the Tontec 2.8" drivers that I'm using.  This is still a work in progress.

The major issue I'm running into is that I can't use the LCD w/ the touch
screen.  If they are separate then all is well.  As soon as they are used 
together the LCD locks up and requires restarting the deamon, and the touch 
screen either becomes mostly unresponsive or outright locks until unloaded
and reload (sometimes requires a reboot).
