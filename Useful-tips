Accessing buttons:

First thing go install http://wiringpi.com/ as that is the most useful tool
to start with for this.  As we're going to discuss this in terms of command
line.

After that you need to know the four GPIOs for the four buttons.  They are listed from RIGHT to LEFT (yes backwards).

GPIO-24 - Button 1 (K1)
GPIO-23 - Button 2 (K2)
GPIO-22 - Button 3 (K3)
GPIO-21 - Button 4 (K4)

To access them you need to first prepare them.  As an example I'll use 
Button 1.  I'll be using the -g modifier in gpio as I like to use the GPIO
numbers when possible.

##  Set GPIO-24 pin as an input device
$ gpio -g mode 24 in   

## Set GPIO-24 "high" so that it is active
$ gpio -g mode 24 up

##  Loop forever reading GPIO-24.  If the button is not pressed it will
## return "1".  If the button is pushed it will return "0".
$ while true; do gpio -g read 24; done
